	<h2>Worm</h2>
	  <p> The story takes place in a fictional world where a large number of individuals have super powers. These powers are unlocked when a individual goes throug ha tramatic experience and can influence their powers. The main character, Taylor, is one such individual, who's bullies stuffed her in a locker and poured insects on her. I can't go much futher without spoiling the book, but it is a great series and is free.</p>

	<h2>Gregory the overlander</h2>
	  <p>Another great series, this book takes place in roughly modern times and folows the protagonist gregory and his little brother in a undergorund world filled with dangers abound. Though the most intresting part of the book is the prophecies that follow the main character throughout the series.</p>

	<h2>Lorax the original</h2>
	  <p>Original lorax video, found it on youtube and think people should watch it. It is actually pretty good and I think it was better than the movie.</p>
